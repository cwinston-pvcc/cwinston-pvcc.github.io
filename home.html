    The decision in Brown v. Board of Education was a mighty one. It turned on its head a doctrine espoused in an earlier Supreme Court case, 
    Plessy v. Ferguson, that said segregated facilities and entities were legal as long as they were equal. The Supreme Court ruled in 
    Brown v. Board of Education that separate facilities for blacks and whites were inherently unequal and unconstitutional. What was the 
    background of this decision?

    <h2>Background</h2> 
    <p>Right after the Civil War there were several amendments to the Constitution passed which cemented certain rights – one , 
      the thirteenth amendment made slavery illegal, the fifteenth, made racial discrimination in elections illegal, and then there 
      was the fourteenth.  It is the fourteenth amendment which stated: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge 
      the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, 
      without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." ("Amdt14.1 Overview")</p>

    ALIGN="right" title="HOME1"></iframe>The complainants in the Brown v. Board of Education challenged the ruling of Plessy vs Ferguson in 1896 
    that said segregation laws did not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The challenges to this ruling started 
    as early as 1935, when the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) brought a suit against segregated law schools. 
    The case was brought by Thurgood Marshall, who was to be the main lawyer in Brown v. Board of Education. <p>These were a number of subsequent challenges- 11 in all - and these were met with mixed results from the Court.
       The cases involving the denial of the admission of black students to law schools generally did well and the black students won the right 
       to admission as there were few states that had all black law schools that could be deemed equal. Marshall and the NAACP were thus encouraged 
       to press cases regarding equal access to all white public elementary, junior and high schools. </p> 
       <h2>The Litigants</h2>
       <p>The Brown v. Board of Education case was a combining of 5 of these such cases.  
        The first was brought by Oliver Brown, whose daughter was denied admission to a local white elementary school in Topeka, Kansas, requiring her 
        to get up early to walk and ride the bus to a black school much farther away from her home.  Their case was soon taken up by the NAACP and Thurgood Marshall 
        and combined with similar cases in Virginia, Delaware, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia.  The cases were initially heard by the U.S. District Court which ruled 
        in favor of the school boards.  The NAACP then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear  the case.  </p> <h2>The Arguments and the Ruling</h2><p>Arguments began on this case in December, 1952. Of great significance in September, 1953, 
          was the appointment by President Dwight Eisenhower of Earl Warren to the Court. Warren was to go on to write the unanimous opinion in the Brown case, 
          overturning Plessy v Ferguson and declaring that separate but equal schools were inherently unequal, and harmed the mental capacities of black children.  
          They based the latter argument on various sociological tests, some by noted black sociologist, Kenneth Clark, and other data.</p> <p>Marshall also successfully debunked the theory that if white children went 
            to school with black children that the white children would fall apart. On the other hand, the ruling stated, “To separate [black children] from others of similar age and qualifications solely 
            because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.” ("Brown v. Board of Education") 
            The unanimous 9-0 decision stated that such segregation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This case is widely recognized as the harbinger of the modern day civil rights movement of the late 50s, 60s, and 70s.</p>
